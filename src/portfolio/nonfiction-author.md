### Non-Fiction Author Website

The answer boils down to the **purpose of a non-fiction author website** - to sell books, get visitors to sign up for newsletter and connect with readers.

A non-fiction author website at the very least must include:

*   Author bio
*   Services offered
*   Newsletter sign up form
*   List of books and ways to purchase
