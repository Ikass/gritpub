# You can delete my other comments, but it's helpful to leave the following one here so you don't forget how to run your Netlify CMS.
# If you don't run this command, the CMS will keep giving you errors when you try to login

# When you want to use Netlify CMS:
# Run your Eleventy serve commands, (mine is "npm run start")
# In another terminal window, simultaneously run: "npx netlify-cms-proxy-server" for local backend

# Add your collections. Here's an example of multiple collections:
collections:
  - name: "blog" # Used in routes, e.g., /admin/collections/blog
    label: "Blog" # Used in the UI
    folder: "src/posts" # The path to the folder where the documents are stored  - **
    create: true # Allow users to create new documents in this collection
    slug: "{{slug}}" # Filename template, e.g., YYYY-MM-DD-title.md - **
    fields: # The fields for each document, usually in front matter
      - {
          label: "Layout",
          name: "layout",
          widget: "hidden",
          default: "post.njk",
        } # -** can use blog template alias optionally if you set it up previously
      - { label: "Tags", name: "tags", widget: "hidden", default: "blog" } # - ** - This is optional
      - { label: "Title", name: "title", widget: "string" }

      - { label: "Featured Image", name: "image", widget: "image" }
