      <h3>Author One-Page Website template</h3>
      <p>Building an author platform - even a simple one-page website - can feel overwhelming.</p>
      <p>What information and sections should it include, and in what order to be effective? And what can be left out?</p>
      <p>The answer boils down to the <strong>purpose of an author website</strong> - to sell books, get visitors to sign up for newsletter and connect with readers.</p>
      <p>Here is the minimum content sections a simple author website must include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Author bio</li>
        <li>Newsletter sign up form</li>
        <li>List of books and ways to purchase</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Connecting with readers</h3>
      <p>One of the primary reasons for having a dedicated author website is to <strong>connect with readers and loyal fans</strong>. An attractive picture and a short author bio will greatly help.</p>
      <p>Just as important, if not more, is to <strong>build a mailing list</strong> to be able to get in touch with readers directly, and ultimately sell more books.</p>

      <h3>Selling more books</h3>
      <p>Selling more books is the primary <strong>business goal</strong> of any author. As much as we love to write, we also like to eat. :)</p>
      <p>Therefore an effective author website should help sell books. This template showcases latest books, with cover images, book titles and short descriptions, as well as links to purchase.</p>
