      <h3>Non-Fiction Author Website template</h3>
      <p>Building an author platform - especially for non-fiction authors or small business owners - can feel overwhelming.</p>
      <p>What information and sections should it include, and in what order to be effective? And what can be left out?</p>
      <p>The answer boils down to the <strong>purpose of a non-fiction author website</strong> - to sell books, get visitors to sign up for newsletter and connect with readers.</p>
      <p>A non-fiction author website at the very least must include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Author bio</li>
        <li>Services offered</li>
        <li>Newsletter sign up form</li>
        <li>List of books and ways to purchase</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

      <h3>Connecting with readers</h3>
      <p>One of the primary reasons for having a dedicated nonfiction author website is to <strong>connect with readers and potential clients</strong>. An attractive picture and a short author bio will greatly help.</p>
      <p>Just as important, if not more, is to <strong>build a mailing list</strong> to be able to get in touch with readers directly, and ultimately sell more books.</p>

      <h3>Selling more books</h3>
      <p>Selling more books is the primary <strong>business goal</strong> of any non-fiction author.</p>
      <p>Therefore an effective nonfiction author website should help sell books and thus incrase business.</p>
      <p>This template showcases book series, with cover images, has individual pages for books, as well as links to purchase.</p>
