      <p>I love stories. Hearing, reading, watching or playing them. I even started dabbling in writing fiction. Needless to say, my library of “how to write” books is  excessive.</p>
      <p>I also love the Internet and how it empowers us to share our stories. A website is a must for any writer. An <em>effective</em> website is a win-win for both sides - tailored to meet the business needs of the author, while providing a pleasant experience for the reader.</p>
    <!-- Now the question is how to make it render into any CMS?? -->
      <!-- {% include aside-right.html title="Aside Title, Yay!" content="This is my sample note." %} -->
      <p>I specialise in building effective websites for authors, freelance writers and solo business owners - with business goals in mind, crafted using modern web development best-practices and standards, that are fast, secure, with a robust information architecture and well designed.</p>
