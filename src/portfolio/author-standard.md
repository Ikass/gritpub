### Author Standard Website template

Building an author platform - even a simple one-page website - can feel overwhelming.

What information and sections should it include, and in what order to be effective? And what can be left out?

The answer boils down to the **purpose of an author website** - to sell books, get visitors to sign up for newsletter and connect with readers.

Here is the minimum content sections a simple author website must include:

*   Author bio
*   Newsletter sign up form
*   List of books and ways to purchase

### Connecting with readers

One of the primary reasons for having a dedicated author website is to **connect with readers and loyal fans**. An attractive picture and a short author bio will greatly help.

Just as important, if not more, is to **build a mailing list** to be able to get in touch with readers directly, and ultimately sell more books.

### Selling more books

Selling more books is the primary **business goal** of any author. As much as we love to write, we also like to eat. :)

Therefore an effective author website should help sell books. This template showcases latest books, with cover images, book titles and short descriptions, as well as links to purchase.
