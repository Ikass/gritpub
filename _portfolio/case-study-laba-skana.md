      <h3>Effective Freelancer Website</h3>
      <p>For a professional freelancer offering DJ and sound engineer services, <strong>an effective website is a key client acquisition tool</strong>.</p>
      <p>It has to load fast, be simple and intuitive to use and has to guide the visitor to the desired action to achieve business goals.</p>
      <p>The old version was created using a website builder platform, that initially offered an easy enough DIY solution and produced a reasonably good looking website.</p>
      <p>However, the long loading times, disconnected design across website pages and resulting bad user experience were obviously hurting business.</p>

      <h3>Challenges with the Project</h3>
      <p>The old version of the freelancer website was build using a visual website builder, and it suffered from the common shortcomings of a website builder platform:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>complicated to make design and functionality coherent across the pages and effective for a freelancer website;</li>
        <li>poor performance, negatively affecting search engine optimisation results and user experience of visitors;</li>
        <li>hard to update and maintain, with questionable security;</li>
        <li>resulting in a cluttered DIY-looking design and navigation, giving a poor user experience for visitors and ultimately costing business.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Greatly Improved Performance</h3>
      <!-- <p>The freelancer website was redesigned using modern web development technologies, resulting in a clean and effective design, excellent performance and robust security.</p> -->
      <p>By using modern web development approach I was able to achieve <strong>a perfect 100% performance score</strong>. Previously it took more than 5 seconds to fully load the site. Now it loads in less than 2 seconds, even with plenty of pictures.</p>
      <p>Performance and security were improved by choosing modern technologies that don't rely on various 3rd party plugins for essential functions and introducing unnecessary security and maintenance risks.</p>

      <h3>Mobile-Optimised and Responsive</h3>
      <p>The new website is fully responsive and mobile-optimised, as most visitors browse websites on mobile devices.</p>
      <p>It also helps with search engine optimisation, as Google strongly prefers websites optimised for mobile viewing.</p>

      <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
      <p>Built with modern web development technologies. In particular, the website is built with Jekyll static site generator, outputting pure HTML and CSS, with a touch of JavaScript for some added functionality such as the online chat.</p>
      <p>Meaning, the website consists of static files that can be served blazing fast, are easy to maintain, and provide top-notch security and peace of mind. Less moving parts mean less can go wrong.</p>
      <p>The website is hosted on a globally distributed CDN, meaning that wherever your visitors are in the world, they get served your website from a server close by, thus further improving the already fast viewing experience.</p>
      <p>Content can be easily updated via an open-source CMS.</p>
      <p>The result - fast, secure and easy to maintain website.</p>
